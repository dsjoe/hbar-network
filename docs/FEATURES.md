## **Features**

_A relatively detailed outline of the features the platform will provide_

Simple account tracker - should be able to pull up the full activity history of any account, including which HTS token types it accepts, etc. 

Transaction throughput bar graphing tool - a robust transaction volume explorer, where users can select start/end dates/times and denote a desired level of granularity (whether aggregated by seconds, minutes, hours, etc) to see a bar graph of how many of every kind of transaction went through during each timeframe. Mouse-over should give further detail on tx activity in that specific timeframe, potentially including a pie chart showing the proportion of txs pushed in that timeframe by top transacting accounts. This should be more akin to the level of detail available when exploring price charts on exchanges.

Token Tracker - searchable HTS token database, sortable by any desired parameter including avg price on any future HTS-token-specific exchanges, total supply, existence/lack of flags (kyc, etc), account numbers of controlling account (treasury) for the token, etc. A full list of all accounts with the ability to accept the token should be retrievable and sortable.

Liquidity Analyzer - other analyses have found that the percentage of circulating bitcoins that have not moved for greater than certain timeframes (1y, 3ys, etc) offers interesting insight into eventual parabolic price action. When tokens have been stagnant (whether in "strong hands" or "lost") the decreased liquidity may push the price up as market newcomers struggle to find sellers. A liquidity analyzer should be available for any desired HTS token to determine what proportion of coins have never moved, or have not moved for a certain length of time. This feature only makes sense for fungible tokens.

Correlation Analyzer - BTC is well known for having a high degree of correlation with many other currencies in terms of price movements - when BTC goes up, the market as a whole moves up as well. In theory, hbar would occupy this space within the greater HTS ecosystem of tokens, but this analyzer should offer the ability to pick any two parameters of any two tokens and find the pearson/spearman correlation as those parameters change over time to allow users to determine how token changes are related.
